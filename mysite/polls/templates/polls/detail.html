<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>
<!-- The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. In {{ question.question_text }}, first Django does a dictionary lookup on the object question. Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup – which works, in this case. If attribute lookup had failed, it would’ve tried a list-index lookup. -->
<ul>
{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}			<!-- *set.all is interpreted as the Python code *set.all() -->
    <li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>
{% endfor %}
